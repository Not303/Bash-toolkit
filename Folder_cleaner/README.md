A Bash script to detect and delete common junk files like .tmp, .bak, .DS_Store, and more.
## Suggested Folders to Use This Script On

You can try cleaning:

- `~/Downloads` – often filled with unused installers, docs, and zip files
- `/tmp` – temporary files created by system processes
- `~/.cache` – cache files from various apps
- `/mnt/c/Users/YOURNAME/Downloads` – Windows downloads folder (if using WSL)
- `/mnt/c/Users/YOURNAME/AppData/Local/Temp` – Windows temp folder
replace the "Users" and "YOURNAME" with the actual paths

Use with caution and always review the list before deleting files!
